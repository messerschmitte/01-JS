# 01-JS
This project is created as a practice for using native javascript to create a web based version of Rock Paper Scissors structured according to Model View Control (MVC). The idea is that this game can be played single player and multi player. After this is finished the creator will move on to create the same game with javascript classes strictly in MVC architecture and focused around Object Orientied Programming (OOP)
